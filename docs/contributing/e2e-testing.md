# End-to-End Testing with Keycloak and Playwright

E2E tests use a real Keycloak instance and Playwright browser automation to validate full OIDC round-trips that mocked tests cannot catch.

## Test Coverage Layers

| Layer | What it catches |
|-------|----------------|
| Unit tests (`OidcAuthServiceTests`) | PKCE, URL encoding, token validation logic, expiry handling |
| Integration tests (`OidcAuthControllerTests`, `AccountControllerOidcTests`) | HTTP routing, middleware, cookie/token handling (mocked IdP) |
| **E2E tests** | Real browser redirects, actual Keycloak protocol, full OIDC round-trip |

## Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose
- Node.js 26+
- GitHub Packages credentials (for building the app image)

## Running Locally

```bash
cd e2e

# Start Keycloak + Cleanuparr
docker compose -f docker-compose.e2e.yml up -d --build

# Install dependencies and browser
npm install
npx playwright install chromium

# Run tests (global setup waits for services and provisions the app automatically)
npx playwright test

# Tear down
docker compose -f docker-compose.e2e.yml down
```

## How It Works

1. **Docker Compose** starts Keycloak (with a pre-configured realm) and the Cleanuparr app
2. **Playwright `globalSetup`** (`tests/global-setup.ts`) automatically waits for both services and creates the admin account. OIDC is left disabled by default — each OIDC spec configures the state it needs in its own `beforeAll` and restores it in `afterAll`
3. **`oidc-link.spec.ts`** logs in with local credentials, navigates to settings, and verifies the UI link flow against Keycloak
4. **`oidc-login.spec.ts`** verifies the full OIDC login flow — clicking "Sign in with Keycloak" on the login page, authenticating at Keycloak, and landing on the dashboard. It establishes its own linked subject via the shared `linkOidcViaBrowser` helper in `beforeAll`

OIDC specs are independent of each other; the previous numeric-prefix ordering was removed once each spec became self-contained.

## CI

E2E tests run automatically on PRs that touch `code/**` or `e2e/**` via `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`.
